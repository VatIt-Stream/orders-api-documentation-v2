  summary: Create a JWT token for subsequent requests
  description: >
    Post in the username and password credentials to receive a JWT token to
    be used for authentication. <br/><br/>

    Once you have done this and received the response token, you may use it in the
    Header of subsequent requests for authentication:<br/><br/>

    `Authorization: Bearer {INSERT TOKEN HERE}` <br/><br/>

    The token will last for 6 hours or until midnight (GMT), whichever is longer, after which a new token will need to be
    generated
