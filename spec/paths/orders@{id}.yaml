    This will return all the details of the specified order.
    <br><br>`NOTE` <ul>
      <li>When the order is finalized and an invoice has been issued the <b>invoice_data</b> field will be populated in the response. Prior to invoicing <b>invoice_data</b> will be blank.</li>
      <li>The Vat & Duties will be a line item in the <b>invoice_data</b>, again this will only appear when the order is invoiced and the VAT & Duties are finalized and confirmed to be accurate.</li>
      <li>All document fields ending with <b>_link</b> will have a temporary link to the file, each time a new GET request is made a new link will be generated with a new expiry.</li>
    </ul>

    `Downloading files (such as the customs clearance documents)`<ul>
      <li>All documents for an order are available by performing a GET request to the URL of the document.</li>
      <li>This URL is provided in the order parameters returned by this GET request and include the _link suffix.</li>
      <li>All links expire within a short period after this initial GET request, if you experience a broken document link you will need to repeat this order GET request.</li>
      <li>This order GET response does not include the actual file binary, but rather a link to the actual file. Following this link will yield the actual file.</li>
      <li>An example response parameter for a link to a file is <b>customs_clearance_document_link</b>.</li>
